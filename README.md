# Kama

## Overview

Kama is an cross-platform desktop fostwear designed for <u>Michelson fringe counting</u>. 

It enables **real-time capture**, **processing** and **data analyse**.

## Features

- **Ring Center Detection**: Detects interference ring centers using traditional algorithms based on <u>OpenCV</u>

- **Real-time Image Acquisition**: Captures live images from the [IP camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_camera) for real-time observation.

- **Brightness Analysis**: This is my own optimized counting algorithm with a high accuracy.

- **Data Visualization**: Counting results displayed based on [pyqtgraph](https://www.pyqtgraph.org/).

- **Interactive Interface**: GUI are poewred by [Qt](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/), a High performance GUI framework.

## Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV
- **GUI Framework**: PyQt
